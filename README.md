> The course gives students the opportunity to conduct a group project. The project will be GIS-based programming. Students will complete and orally present their group’s project at the end of the term. You are free to choose any topic of interest, but it must first be discussed with the course instructor and TA. For this purpose, students will submit a proposal (800 words maximum) by November 6, and they will receive feedback ahead of the class on November 13, which is designed to work on this proposal, solve doubts and receive guidance related to data and analytical approaches from the teaching team. Your project should aim to develop Python scripts, modules, and packages or apply existing Python packages and GIS methods introduced in the course to solve any geographic or environmental problem of interest.

> You are expected to work in groups of two or three, depending on class size. Students should identify an area of common research interest, find data, and apply GIS methods introduced in this course to solve a geographic/environmental problem. You can only use up to two data sources that had been given to you for previous lab assignments in this course. Your write-up should not be less than 4000 words excluding references.

> For project presentation, each group member is expected to participate and present their group’s research orally in class and answer questions directly or tangentially related to their work. You are required to work as a team to complete your projects, so please try to resolve issues with your group members and do not immediately report your group members to the course instructor or TA without first attempting to solve the issue within your group. The instructor will provide the chance to group members to evaluate their peers. Marks may be adjusted upward if they demonstrate an exceptional collaborative effort to complete their project. Conversely, the instructor may adjust a group member’s marks downward if they are not participating/collaborating in their group’s project.
